Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent
I implemented Logistic Regression from scratch to predict heart disease, utilizing the following methods and analyses:

a)Logistic Regression with Batch Gradient Descent: Training with cross-entropy loss, and plotting training/validation loss and accuracy across iterations to analyze model convergence.

b)Feature Scaling Comparison: Investigates the impact of Min-max scaling vs. no scaling on model convergence by plotting loss vs. iteration.

c)Performance Metrics: Presents a confusion matrix for the validation set, along with precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, providing insight into the modelâ€™s performance.

d)Optimization Algorithms: Compares Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (with varying batch sizes) in terms of convergence speed and stability.

e)k-fold Cross-Validation (k=5): Evaluates model robustness by reporting average and standard deviation for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across the folds.

f)Early Stopping: Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting and tests different learning rates and regularization techniques (L1 and L2).
